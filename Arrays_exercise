/*
1. Write a C++ program that will prompt the user to input ten integer values.
The program will display the smallest and greatest of those values. It also displays the value that occurs the most.

2. In this C++ exercise, your are about to write C++ program to display a matrix as shown below. The diagonal of the matrix fills with 0. 
The lower side fills will -1s and the upper side fills with 1s.


 0	 1	 1 	1	 1	 
-1	 0	 1	1	 1
-1	-1	 0 	1  1
-1	-1	-1  0	 1
-1	-1	-1 -1  0


3. C++ arrays: Pascal triangle
This is another C++ exercise about using two-dimensional array of C++. 
By using two-dimensional array, write C++ program to display a table that represents a Pascal triangle of any size. 
In Pascal triangle, the first and the second rows are set to 
1. Each element of the triangle (from the third row downward) is the sum of the element directly above it and the element to the left of the element directly above it. 
See the example Pascal triangle(size=5) below:


1				
1	1			
1	2	1		
1	3	3	1	
1	4	6	4	1
