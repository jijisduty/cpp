/*
1. Write a C++ program that will display the calculator menu.
The program will prompt the user to choose the operation choice (from 1 to 5). Then it asks the user to input two integer vales for the calculation. See the sample below.
 
MENU
          1. Add
          2. Subtract
          3. Multiply
          4. Divide
          5. Modulus
Enter your choice: 1
Enter your two numbers: 12 15
Result: 27
 
Continue? y
 
The program also asks the user to decide whether he/she wants to continue the operation. 
If he/she input ‘y’, the program will prompt the user to choose the operation gain. Otherwise, the program will terminate.



2. Write a C++ program (using function overloaded) to sort 10 integer values, or 10 long values, or 10 double values.
